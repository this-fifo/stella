# Stella

Stella is a quickly interactive way of visualizing a GitHub's user starred repos (try it live over at [stellae.dev](https://stellae.dev))

It relies on GitHub's API to query for a specific user starred repos while providing a clean minimalistic gallery to browse the results

## Running Locally

Stella was built using create-react-app, after cloning the repo run

```
yarn && yarn start
```

For building use the `yarn build` variant

## Extra

While I was developing Stella I accidentally came across Mr. Dash O'Pepper

He seems to only exist in GitHub's API, you can read more about that [here](https://filipeherculano.dev/blog/dash-o-pepper/).
